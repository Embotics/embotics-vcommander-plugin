# Embotics Commander Jenkins Plugin  
This plugin allows Embotics Commander users to create jobs in Jenkins  
and connect to Commander via rest api connections through the plugin.  
With this integration you can submit service requests, get status on  
existing requests and apply command workflows to Embotics-managed  
virtual machines.  
  
Embotics Commander multi-cloud management platform is the fastest  
and easiest way to automate provisioning, enforce governance, and  
enable self-service IT across virtualized, private and public cloud  
infrastructures.
